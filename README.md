## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Computer Science undergraduate specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, with a passion for building intelligent, data-driven systems and intuitive user-centric applications.

With hands-on experience in both frontend development and predictive modeling, I aim to bridge the gap between user experience and complex computational logic. My academic background, combined with practical exposure to real-world projects, has strengthened my problem-solving mindset and adaptability in fast-paced environments.

> I believe in continuous learning and strive to keep up with emerging technologies while contributing meaningfully to any team or organization I become a part of.
